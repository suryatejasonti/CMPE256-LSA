    "\n",
    "As mentioned in class, networks, also known as graphs, are comprised of individual entities and their representatives. The technical term for these are nodes and edges, and when we draw them we typically use circles (nodes) and lines (edges). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will work with a social network of seventh graders, in which nodes are individual students, and edges represent their relationships. Edges between individuals show how often the seventh graders indicated other seventh graders as their favourite.\n",

    "## Data Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `networkx` implementation, graph objects store their data in dictionaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are part of the attribute `Graph.node`, which is a dictionary where the key is the node ID and the values are a dictionary of attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Edges are part of the attribute `Graph.edge`, which is a nested dictionary. Data are accessed as such: `G.edge[node1][node2]['attr_name']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the dictionary implementation of the graph, any hashable object can be a node. This means strings and tuples, but not lists and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load some real network data to get a feel for the NetworkX API. This [dataset](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/moreno_seventh) comes from a study of 7th grade students.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This directed network contains proximity ratings between studetns from 29 seventh grade students from a school in Victoria. Among other questions the students were asked to nominate their preferred classmates for three different activities. A node represents a student. An edge between two nodes shows that the left student picked the right student as his answer. The edge weights are between 1 and 3 and show how often the left student chose the right student as his favourite.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions 1: Can you use the data out.moreno_seventh_seventh for edges information and ent.moreno_seventh_seventh.student.gender for nodes inforamtion to generate a graph with NetworkX nx.DiGraph() function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions 2: Can you find out some network statistics of this graph, for example, nodes number, edges number, how many are males and how many are females, etc? More properties you can find are welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: Try to count the number of \"unrequited\" friendships, that is, they have rated another student as their favourite at least once, but that other student has not rated them as their favourite at least once. Specifically, get a list of edges for which the reverse edge is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions 4: Can you visualize this network? you can try networkX.draw() function or nxviz package."
